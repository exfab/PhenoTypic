# PhenoScope: A Python Bio-Image Processing Development Framework
![Development Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Pre--Alpha-red)

An image processing framework created from NSF Ex-FAB BioFoundry

---

## Overview
This framework aims to provide a toolkit & modular design framework that streamlines the process of creating image analysis tools and pipelines. 
By following a structured design architecture, developers can integrate their own versions of computer vision operations into the ecosystem without 
having to create entirely new packages every time. The framework also works as a toolkit that integrates various developed modules from other available 
tools into a unified library.

## Installation
```  
git clone https://github.com/Xander-git/PhenoScope.git
cd PhenoScope
pip install -e .
```
