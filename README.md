An image processing framework created from NSF Ex-FAB BioFoundry

---

## Overview
This framework aims to provide a toolkit & modular design framework that streamlines the process of creating image analysis tools and pipelines. 
By following a structured design architecture, developers can integrate their own versions of computer vision operations into the ecosystem without 
having to create entirely programs every time. The framework also works as a toolkit that integrates various developed tools from other available 
tools into a unified packages.
